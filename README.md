### How to Test?
1. Install The Required Dependencies

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

2. Run the Program !.

3. All the other testing instructions have been hard corded.


### Code Explanation:

1. main.py
This is used to test the entire project.

2. face.py
This module includes the features of facial recognition which includes:
   - Identification of human faces using opencv.
   - Remembering Faces by converting facial images into 128 dimension vectors and storing it.
   - Traversing through the stored data to find the similarity (norm) between faces.

3. parking.py
 This module deploys a custom trained model. For test cases we have provided different combinations of car arrangements in one specific parking slot.Based on that we provide the voice based assistance.

4. person.py
This module is used to recognize known people using face recognition. It is used to log the new or unknown people' entry/exit time for easy access.

5. essentialcam.py
This module deploys a custom trained model which involves combination of varieties of features:
   - Identification of animals
   - Weapon Detection
   - Fall Detection

6. vehicles.py
This module deploys a custom trained model which involves:
   - Identification of known vehicle.
   - Logging of unknown vehicles with entry/exit time.

7. blocked.py
This module identifies any disturbances in CCTV cameras.

8. burglar.py
This module identifies any burglars jumping over the wall.
